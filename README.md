Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer who is passionate about distributed systems, database systems, operating systems and all things comp sci!

My experince includes building fleet orchestration, security / vulnerability management systems to other full stack work. I have also dabbled in low level kernel work as an intern on ESX kernel. Currently learning databases internals by building one from scratch here: [fetadb](https://github.com/theshubhamp/fetadb)

Here's a highlight of my public work:
* Contributed the ability to JIT compile recursive functions in RustPython (Python implemented in Rust): https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/pull/5473
* YAQL Interpreter written in Rust: [yaql](https://github.com/theshubhamp/yaql)
* SQL Database atop Badger KV, in Go: [fetadb](https://github.com/theshubhamp/fetadb)
